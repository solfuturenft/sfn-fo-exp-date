📜 SOLFUTURENFT Smart Contracts
This repository contains Anchor-based smart contracts powering SOLFUTURENFT — a decentralized protocol for trading NFT futures and options on the Solana blockchain.

⚙️ Overview
These smart contracts enable:

Creation of futures contracts based on NFT prices

Creation and exercise of call/put options tied to NFT floor prices

Secure deposit, locking, and release of SOL

(Upcoming) Oracle integration for floor price validation

All interactions are non-custodial, trustless, and enforced by programmatic rules directly on-chain.

🔁 Contract Types
🔹 NFT Futures Contract
Initiator deposits 1 NFT and defines:

Expiry date

Target price (in SOL or USDC)

Counterparty fulfills the contract by depositing the agreed amount

Upon expiry:

If the NFT floor price ≥ target price → NFT is transferred to buyer

Else → NFT is returned to seller and funds refunded

🔹 NFT Options Contract (WIP)
Supports Call and Put options based on floor price

Writer locks NFT or funds

Buyer pays a premium

Option can be exercised before expiry

Uses an on-chain oracle (e.g., Tensor) to validate price at settlement

Anchor CLI

Rust

2. Build and Deploy
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/solfuturenft/sfn-fo-exp-date.git
cd sfn-fo-exp-date/programs/solfuturenft
anchor build
anchor deploy
Devnet Program ID: ERXrCZBaHPRgzTwHE71TJUh6zGCqPqQyRHL8xJgK59z4

🧪 Testing the Contracts
Contracts can be tested on Solana Devnet

Use the Anchor IDL file: .nft_futures.json

Compatible front-end: sfn-frontend

Smart contracts use SPL Token + Anchor framework

Price feeds are sourced from Tensor floor price API (coming)

📌 Notes
The protocol allows two parties to enter trustless agreements on NFT price speculation.

Contracts support mutable terms, allowing for margin deposits and specific collection IDs.

Oracle-based validation ensures fair and decentralized settlement.
